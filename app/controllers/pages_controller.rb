# This is the one and only controller for the application.
# Each method, except "initialize", is a controller action with a
# corresponding route named /<action>. For example, the method "home" is a controller action
# invoked via the route "/home".
#
# Most of the actions cannot be invoked unless the user has signed in, which action
# makes him become the current_user(). This check is handled by a before_filter defined on the
# parent ApplicationController, which takes a strict view, requiring sign in for all things
# that are not explicitly allowed without sign in.
#
# Many of the actions cannot be invoked unless the user has signed in and has appropriate
# authorization to invoke the action. These checks are handled by before filters on
# # the parent ApplicationController, which
# take a strict view, disallowing all actions unless the action has explicitly been declared
# to be allowable without signin, or unless the action has explicitly been declared
# to be authorized for the current user. Making declarations regarding sign-in and authorization
# is handled by the functions def_sign_in() and def_authorization()

# Two very common objects in this app are @user and @micropost. They are dereferenced
# from the params by a before_filter and are available to each action defined below,
# so long as :user_id and/or :micropost_id are given in params, respectively.
