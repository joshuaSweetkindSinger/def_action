  # ============ Action Definition Logic
  # This section defines constructs for specifying a controller action based on the following framework:
  # an action has these parts:
  #  - a permission check, which, if it does not pass, results in the action not being executed.
  #  - a main body, which executes the api-level logic of the controller action.
  #  - a ui body, which updates the user interface after the main action has taken place.
  #
  # This section also defines def_action, a modified form of def that allows one to define the above parts
  # all in the same place. Below is an example.
  #
  # def_action :home do |action|
  #   action.permitted? {authorize_action_on_self} # specify that all (signed-in) users can request this action.
  #   action.main do  # specify the main body of the action before handing off to view.
  #     @micropost = current_user.microposts.build # empty micropost for form template
  #     @posts     = current_user.feed.paginate(page: params[:page])
  #   end
  #
  #   # This is an optional section that specifies ui actions.
  #   action.ui do
  #     render 'home_page'
  #   end
  #
  #   action.route(path: '/user_profile/:id') # this is an optional route specification. If not supplied, a default is generated.
  # end


  # This is the toplevel method for defining an action that knows how to specify its own
  # permission checks, main body, and ui components.
  def self.def_action (action)
    spec = ActionSpec.new(self, action) # This crucially holds information about controller class and action name.
    yield spec  # This defines the various action methods: permissions check, main action, ui action.

    # This combines the ui and main methods defined in the yield above into a single method with the proper name.
    # It does not wrap up the permission check, which is handled separately by a before_filter. This implementation is important, because
    # there is no guarantee that a developer will use def_action to create his/her actions. Using a before_filter
    # guarantees that all controller actions are subject to permissions checks.

  # ========= Routes

  def self.routes
    @@routes
  end

  # A helper class for specifying route information.
  # Example: route = RouteSpec.new(PagesController, :user_profile, path: '/user_profile/:id', via: :get)
  # Example: route = RouteSpec.new(PagesController, :foo) {match '/foo', via: :post, to: 'mycontroller#foo', as: :foo}
  #
  # There are two mutually exclusive ways to specify the route:
  #   a) you can pass keyword args for :path, :verb, :to, :name, :controller (many of these have defaults. You don't need to specify them all)or
  #   b) you can supply a block that just calls a route-mapper method, e.g. "match". The block will be called
  # in the context of the route mapper when the route object receives an add_to_route_map message. Each of these ways
  # is illustrated above in the examples.
  #
  # Keyword args: :path, :verb, :to, :name do the obvious things.
  # There are multiple ways to specify :to. It can be passed in explicitly as, e.g. 'pages#sign_in'. This form
  # always takes precedence over other forms. Or, it can be derived from the names of the :controller and :action.
  # In its turn, the name of the :controller can be derived from the class object :controller_class if this is passed in.

  #
  # Aliases
  # The :verb component can also be specified using the :via keyword.
  # The :name component can also be specified using the :as keyword
  #
  # Defaults
  # The :verb, :name , :to, and :path keyword args are defaulted if no name or path is supplied.
  # :verb value defaults to :get
  # :name value defaults to :action if :action is supplied.
  # :to value defaults to "<controller>#<action>" if :controller and :action are supplied, or if
  #     :controller_class and :action are supplied.
  # :path value defaults to /<name>
  # :controller value defaults to a short name based on the name of controller_class, e.g., 'PagesController', as
  #     a class name, goes to 'pages' as the value of :controller.
  #
  # If nothing is specified except the controller class and the action, say Pages Controller and :foo, then
  # # the default route generated is
  # match '/foo', via: :get, to: 'pages#foo', as: :foo
  class RouteSpec

  # ============== Permission Logic
  # Many actions require the current user to have special permissions before
  # they can be executed. This section defines helpers
  # to aid in determining whether the current user has correct permissions to execute the requested action.
  # Use def_permission to define the permission conditions pertaining to an action.
  # If no permission conditions are specified, the action will not be allowed by default.

  # Associate the specified permission block with the specified action.
  # When the controller is called upon to execute an action like :create_post,
  # it first calls the associated permission block in the context of the controller object
  # to see whether the current user has sufficient permission to take
  # the action. If the block returns true, then the action can be taken.
  #
  # IMPLEMENTATION: We define a method whose name is a function of action and whose body is the one supplied.
  def self.def_permission (action, &block)
    define_method(permission_check_name(action)) do

    respond_to?(permission_check) && send(permission_check)
  end


  # ========== Authorization Condition methods
  # These methods define typical cases for permitting an action. Note that virtually all
  # authorization methods require there to be a current user (i.e. ,a signed-in user), and they
  # must explicitly check for this. They can't assume that there is a signed-in user.

  # The current user and admin can both take actions on @user.
