    # ============ Action Definition Logic
  # This section defines constructs for specifying a controller action based on the following framework:
  # an action has these parts:
  #  - a permission check, which, if it does not pass, results in the action not being executed.
  #  - a main body, which executes the api-level logic of the controller action.
  #  - a ui body, which updates the user interface after the main action has taken place.
  #
  # This section also defines def_action, a modified form of def that allows one to define the above parts
  # all in the same place. Below is an example.
  #
  # def_action :home do |action|
  #   action.permitted? {authorize_action_on_self} # specify that all (signed-in) users can request this action.
  #   action.main do  # specify the main body of the action before handing off to view.
  #     @micropost = current_user.microposts.build # empty micropost for form template
  #     @posts     = current_user.feed.paginate(page: params[:page])
  #   end
  #
  #   # This is an optional section that specifies ui actions.
  #   action.ui do
  #     render 'home_page'
  #   end
  #
  #   action.route(path: '/user_profile/:id') # this is an optional route specification. If not supplied, a default is generated.
  # end


  # This is the toplevel method for defining an action that knows how to specify its own
  # permission checks, main body, and ui components.
  def self.def_action (action)
    spec = ActionSpec.new(self, action) # This crucially holds information about controller class and action name.
    yield spec  # This defines the various action methods: permissions check, main action, ui action.

    # This combines the ui and main methods defined in the yield above into a single method with the proper name.
    # It does not wrap up the permission check, which is handled separately by a before_filter. This implementation is important, because
    # there is no guarantee that a developer will use def_action to create his/her actions. Using a before_filter
    # guarantees that all controller actions are subject to permissions checks.

  # Example: route = RouteSpec.new(:user_profile, path: '/user_profile/:id')
  #
  # Aliases
  # The :verb component can also be specified using the :via keyword.
  # The :name component can also be specified using the :as keyword
  #
  # Defaults
  # The :verb, :name , :to, and :path keyword args are defaulted if no name or path is supplied.
  # :verb value defaults to :get
  # :name value defaults to action
  # :to value defaults to 'pages/<action>'
  # :path value defaults to /<name>
  #
  # If nothing is specified except the action, say :foo, then the default route generated is
  # match '/foo', via: :get, to: 'pages#foo', as: :foo
  class RouteSpec
    attr_reader :action, :controller, :verb, :to, :name, :path

  # ============== Permission Logic
  # Many actions require the current user to have special permissions before
  # they can be executed. This section defines helpers
  # to aid in determining whether the current user has correct permissions to execute the requested action.
  # Use def_permission to define the permission conditions pertaining to an action.
  # If no permission conditions are specified, the action will not be allowed by default.

  # Associate the specified permission block with the specified action.
  # When the controller is called upon to execute an action like :create_post,
  # it first calls the associated permission block in the context of the controller object
  # to see whether the current user has sufficient permission to take
  # the action. If the block returns true, then the action can be taken.
  #
  # IMPLEMENTATION: We define a method whose name is a function of action and whose body is the one supplied.
  def self.def_permission (action, &block)
    define_method(permission_check_name(action)) do
      instance_eval(&block)
    end
  end

  def self.permission_check_name (action)
    "check_permission_for_#{action}_action"
  end


  # Short-circuit the running of the currently requested controller action if it is not authorized.
  # Note: action_name() is a method that is defined in the context of the controller.
  # It returns params[:action_name], which is the name of the action being requested.

      else

      end

  def action_permitted? (action)
    permission_check = self.class.permission_check_name(action)
    respond_to?(permission_check) && send(permission_check)
  end


  # ========== Authorization Condition methods
  # These methods define typical cases for permitting an action. Note that virtually all
  # authorization methods require there to be a current user (i.e. ,a signed-in user), and they
  # must explicitly check for this. They can't assume that there is a signed-in user.

  # The current user and admin can both take actions on @user.
  def permit_action_on_self
    current_user?(@user) || current_user.admin? if current_user
  end

  # The owner of a micropost or an admin can both manipulate a post.

    current_user.admin? || current_user?(@post.user) if current_user
  end

  # Allow admin to operate on @user so long as @user is not the admin himself.
  def permit_admin_when_not_user

# ============================ MISC

  # Redirect the user back to the previous page (http-referer).
  # This method takes various optional keyword arguments that can alter its behavior.
  # :default_path -- if there is no :back to go to (no http-referer), then redirect to this path instead.
  # :error_page -- if there is no :default_path specified, then, instead of redirecting, render the specified page.
  # <other keyword args> -- all others are passed to redirect_to, e.g., :notify.
